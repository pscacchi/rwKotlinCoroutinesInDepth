Kotlin coroutines: In Depth

2. Implement coroutines in Android

4. Perfomr context switching

Context switching: when the system moves from working on one task in it's queue to another.
	- Change a app to other

A CONTINUATION: save the program state (variabeles and the stack)
	- Is a simple little callback which the system can use to call
          into and switch back to different stack.

After the new task finished and restore the state frome the current continuation.

Context switch  ->> system
Coroutines allow for first clas context switchng mean the program itself can switch contexts.

Coroutines allow fetch multiple values in parallel adn avoid blocking the calling thread.

Contextes switching and suspendability.

When you start a coroutine you're creating a small task 
for the system to finish.

await or withCOntext: systemnd the other task.
