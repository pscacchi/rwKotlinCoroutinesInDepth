3. Debug & test coroutines

1. Handle exception

Exceptions can also occur in coroutines.

You need to seek hot to handle any unwanted errors, which would
otherwise finish your program esarly.

3 effective ways of dealing with exceptions in coroutines.
	1ยบ- try-catch block: intercept de exception and provide some fallback logic.
                 it won't stop your code from running, so you can proceed with it even
                 if think break.
	2ยบ integrate it into the kotlin coroutines API. It colled a coroutine exception
                 handler, andit's use automatically handle exceptions in coroutine.
                     CoroutineExceptionHandler()
                 If an error does occur, the coroutine will stop running, and your coude
                 might not execute fully.
        3ยบ combine both try catch blocks and the exception handler.
                 withContext wraps the value or an exception in a Result object
