Kotlin coroutines: In Depth

1. Dive Into Coroutine

1. Start learning Kotlin Coroutines


Aproach to async code in Android
	- Native: (Very expensive)
		Thread
		Runnable
		Problem: memory leaks y app freeze
	- 3rd party library
		Callback
		Observable
		Multithreading and parallel execution
		Problem: Callback hell, cognitive overhead


Kotlin coroutine
	Easy to write
	Easy to refactor
	Sequential
	Undersatndable

Kotlin coroutines
	- Sequential functions = asynchronous results


concept of suspension of coroutines: it's the means of pausing a function to the use
of suspendable function calls, adding keyword suspend. It
allows you to pause and resume when needed.
When a getter 're fetching a value, the parent coroutine block it
until the data is available.
the code won't expose that neither to callbacks nor to streams of data.

One limitation of suspendability is that you cannot call suspendable functions
outside of other suspendable function or coroutines.
